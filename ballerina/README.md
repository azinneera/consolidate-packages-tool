# Consolidate-packages bal tool

Ballerina inherently supports microservices-style deployments, which are well-suited for microservice orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
However, many enterprise users deploy on VMs or Docker, where managing each service as a separate process increases complexity and resource overhead.
This tool aims to provide a solution tailored to such scenarios by enabling consolidated deployments.
